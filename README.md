# 🖊️ Matplotlib 

*Matplotlib* is a Python library used for *data visualization* It allows Python users to create *charts, graphs and plots* easily It helps in *graphically representing numeric or statistical data*

## 🎯 Why use Matplotlib?

* **Visualize data trends** – To identify patterns and relationships
* **Data analysis & reporting** – To present results clearly
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – To understand data behavior
* **Customizable plots** – Supports colors, styles, labels, subplots and 3D plots

## 🌐 Where Matplotlib is used?

* Data Science & Machine Learning
* Finance & Stock Market
* Engineering & Scientific Research
* Dashboards & Web applications
* Education & Teaching

💡 **Easy way to remember:**

> Python + Matplotlib = Data → Beautiful Plots



# 📊 Matplotlib Plot Types

1. **Line Plot** - Illustrates data trends over continuous intervals
2. **Bar Charts** - Represents categorical data using rectangular bars
3. **Pie Chart** - Shows proportions as slices of a circle
4. **Scatter Plot** - Displays the relationship between two variables using points
5. **Histogram** - Depicts the frequency distribution of data
6. **Box Plot** - Visualizes data distribution, including median, quartiles, and outliers
7. **Heatmap** - Represents data values as colors in a matrix
8. **Subplots** - Arranges multiple plots within a single figure
9. **Stacked Plot** - Displays multiple datasets stacked on top of each other
10. **Bubble Chart** - A scatter plot with points sized according to a variable
11. **Hexbin Plot** - Shows the density of points using hexagonal bins
12. **Styling & Themes** - Customizes plot colors, styles, and overall appearance
13. **Working with Data** - Methods for preparing and plotting data effectively
